			<h2>Profile</h2>
			<p><strong>I am passionate about writing great software that delivers a fantastic customer experience. I thrive at learning new skills, and love working with others. To do this, I create opportunities to learn new skills and embrace new experiences. I find working as a team to be a highly rewarding experience, in which we challenge each other to deliver great results. I am a Computer Science BSc undergraduate at Aberystwyth University, with initiative, drive, and experience of innovation, working with others, and delivering great customer service, now seeking industrial year placement in software engineering to further develop my skills.</strong></p>
			
			<h2>Key Achievements and Skills</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Successfully led teams of 8 people in music practice for church. Many strong personalities required a diplomatic but firm leadership, whilst making sure everyone had a voice and felt valued.</li>
				<li>Achieved Grade 8 piano by the age of 16. A long-held ambition, which by constant effective practice and commitment was achieved with Merit</li>
				<li>Self-taught GCSE sciences and maths from textbooks, with A* results. </li>
				<li>Experienced at coding in Python, which I find excellent for getting programs up and running quickly, as you can focus on the algorithms due to the simple syntax.</li>
				<li>Spent over three weeks helping at an orphanage in Ukraine on my own, where very little English was spoken. This was a daunting trip, which gave me the opportunity to continue to learn some Russian, and to interact with a completely different culture and situation. </li>
				<li>Ran a Badminton Society. I discovered an opportunity to significantly reduce the prices, which I implemented, roughly halving the weekly cost of hiring courts.</li>
				<li>Taught myself to play acoustic guitar and bass guitar following achieving Grade 8 on piano. I applied the knowledge and techniques from learning piano, resulting in becoming proficient enough to play in bands.</li>
				<li>Received a college commendation award for my progress and dedication to A-Level Computer Science. This was awarded out of the entire maths and science faculty. </li>
				<li>Taught myself the google programming language, Go. To practice what I was learning, I started by tackling the Euler Project challenges, which I have found to be an excellent way of getting to grips with a language, as well as encouraging one to develop in their way of approaching a problem.</li>
